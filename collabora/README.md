# Collabora served via nextcloud

This instance has no volumes, so there won't be any persistent config.

* fill in `.env`
`WEB_HOST` refers to collabora, ie: `office.example.com`
`NC_HOST`  refers to nextcloud, ie: `nextcloud.example.com`
The username and password are for collabora, not nextcloud

I haven't used this much at all, It's probably missing bits.
